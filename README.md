# **MAIN OBJECTIVES & FEATURES**

1. <strong>Basic Web Server Setup:</strong><br/>
Setting up a foundational web server using Node.js and ExpressJS and includes creating routes, handling requests, and sending responses.

2. <strong>Middleware (Built-in and 3rd Party):</strong><br/>
As Middleware functions are integral to Express. Using both built-in middleware provided by Express and the utilization of third-party and custom middleware for tasks like request parsing, authentication, and error handling.

3. <strong>Handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):</strong><br/>
CORS is an important security feature implemented by web browsers. Covers configuring CORS headers to control which origins are allowed or denied access to the API.

1. <strong>Best Practices with Error Handling:</strong><br/>
Proper error handling is crucial in any application. Focusing on implementing best practices for error handling, includes capturing and responding to different types of errors.

1. <strong>Routing (Different Endpoints and Dynamic Routing with Express):</strong><br/>
Routing is fundamental to building APIs. Set up various endpoints or routes to handle different types of 
requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Also covers dynamic routing, where routes are defined with variables.

1. <strong>Async CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations:</strong><br/>
CRUD operations are core functionalities of any API. Demonstrate performing these operations asynchronously, ensuring 
efficiency and responsiveness, especially when dealing with databases.

1. <strong>Organizing Codebase Using MVC (Model-View-Controller) Method:</strong><br/>
The MVC pattern is widely used for structuring applications. Project implements and follows this design pattern to organize code into Models (for data management), Views (for rendering), and Controllers (for managing requests and responses) to enhance maintainability & scalability.

1. <strong>Integrating and Interacting with a MongoDB Database, Using Mongoose (ODM):</strong><br/>
MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) that simplifies interactions with it. Connecting, querying, and manipulating data in a MongoDB database using Mongoose.

1. <strong>Implementing Authentication Mechanisms for User Management:</strong><br/>
This feature is crucial for securing APIs. It includes implementing various authentication mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), 
which provide secure authentication tokens, as well as managing user roles and authorizations to control access.

   - <strong>JWT Authentication:</strong><br/>
Implementing JWT authentication involves generating, validating, and managing tokens for secure communication between the client and server.

   - <strong>User Roles:</strong><br/>
User roles are used to categorize users based on their privileges. This feature includes setting up roles like admin, user, etc., and assigning appropriate permissions.

   - <strong>Authorization:</strong><br/>
Authorization ensures that only authenticated users with specific roles or permissions can access certain routes or perform certain actions within the application.

# **FUTURE TOPICS**



<!-- Small container -->
<details>
<summary> Click here to see future topics: </summary>
<br/>

- [x]  <strong>Testing: </strong><br/> Learn about testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, and Jest to write automated tests for your APIs. This will help ensure your code is robust and reliable.

- [x]  <strong>Validation: </strong><br/> Explore libraries like Joi or express-validator to validate incoming data before processing it. This helps in maintaining data integrity.

- [x]  <strong>Error Handling: </strong><br/> Consider diving deeper into different strategies for handling errors, such as custom error classes, error middleware, or even implementing global error handling.

- [x]  <strong>Logging and Debugging: </strong><br/> Familiarize yourself with logging techniques and tools (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) to track application behavior. Also, learn how to debug Node.js applications effectively.

- [ ]  <strong>Deployment and Hosting: </strong><br/> Understand how to deploy your Node.js application on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or other cloud providers. This involves setting up environments, managing databases, and configuring web servers.

- [ ]  <strong>Containerization and Orchestration: </strong><br/> Learn about Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration. This allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for easier deployment and scaling.
